"""
Ingestion Pipeline: PDF to Vector Search.

This module implements the PolicyExplainer ingestion "ETL" workflow:
- Extract: Parse PDF text while preserving page boundaries (for citation accuracy).
- Transform: Clean page text (remove headers/footers/noise) and chunk content into
  LLM-friendly segments with overlap to preserve context across boundaries.
- Load: Persist extracted pages/chunks and add chunks to the vector store for retrieval.

Core design goal:
- Keep citations accurate by ensuring every chunk is associated with a specific page number.
  This enables downstream summarization and QA to cite evidence reliably.

Operational overview:
- `run_ingest(pdf_content)` is the primary entry point used by the API.
- It saves the raw PDF, extracts pages, validates that the document appears to be a health
  insurance policy (keyword-based), chunks each page, persists artifacts, and indexes chunks.

Notes:
- Chunking is performed page-by-page to avoid citations spanning multiple pages.
- Header/footer removal is both heuristic (page numbers) and statistical (repeated lines).
