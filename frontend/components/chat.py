"""
Chat Component for the interactive Q&A assistant.

This module renders the Streamlit chat UI used for PolicyExplainer's interactive Q&A experience.
It is responsible for:

- Displaying a persistent chat transcript stored in `st.session_state.chat_history`.
- Providing a native Streamlit chat input (`st.chat_input`) for user questions.
- Calling the FastAPI backend Q&A endpoint to generate grounded answers.
- Rendering different answer formats, including:
    * Standard Q&A answers (with optional citations)
    * Scenario-style step breakdowns (with step-level citations)
- Handling common networking and server errors gracefully (connection, timeout, HTTP errors).

Expected session_state prerequisites (set elsewhere in the app):
- st.session_state["doc_id"]: str
    The active document identifier returned by the ingest endpoint.
- st.session_state.chat_history: list[dict]
    Chat transcript containing dicts like {"role": "user"|"assistant", "content": "..."}.
- st.session_state.pending_question: Optional[str]
    Used as a two-phase UI pattern to:
      1) immediately display the user's message + "Thinking..."
      2) perform the API call after the UI updates

    Render the PolicyExplainer chat panel.

    UI/interaction pattern:
    - Phase 1: Render transcript + chat input. If user submits a question, store it in
      session state and rerun immediately so the UI reflects the new message.
    - Phase 2: On rerun, detect the pending question and perform the API request, then
      append the assistant response to chat history and rerun again to display it.

    This two-phase approach makes the interface feel responsive by showing:
    - the user's message instantly
    - a "Thinking..." indicator while the backend request is in-flight (from the UI's POV)
